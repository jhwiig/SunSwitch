# SunSwitch

SunSwitch is an application that changes the system appearance (light or dark) of macOS. At sunrise, the appearance is set to light. At sunset, the appearance is set to dark.

## How it Works
CoreBrightness is part of macOS that uses your location to determine when sunrise and sunset is for Night Shift. By using CoreBrightness, SunSwitch does not directly need to ask your location to know when the next sunrise and sunset in your location will be.

You can test that CoreBrightness is working on your Mac by running the following command in a terminal window:

`corebrightnessdiag sunschedule`

If it works correctly, it should output something like this:

    Night Shift Sunset/Sunrise
	{
	isDaylight = 0;
	nextSunrise = "2019-05-30 10:22:37 +0000";
	nextSunset = "2019-05-30 01:11:09 +0000";
	previousSunrise = "2019-05-28 10:23:44 +0000";
	previousSunset = "2019-05-28 01:09:30 +0000";
	sunrise = "2019-05-29 10:23:10 +0000";
	sunset = "2019-05-29 01:10:20 +0000";
	}
